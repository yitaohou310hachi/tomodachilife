# Railway Deployment Skill

This skill provides workflows and knowledge for deploying and managing applications on Railway.

## Overview

Railway is a modern cloud platform for deploying applications. This skill integrates with the Railway MCP tools to provide deployment, monitoring, and management capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before using Railway MCP tools:

1. **Install Railway CLI:** https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli
2. **Authenticate:** Run `railway login` in terminal
3. **Link project:** Run `railway link` in the project directory

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `check-railway-status` | Verify CLI is installed and authenticated |
| `list-projects` | List all Railway projects for the account |
| `list-services` | List services in the linked project |
| `list-deployments` | List deployments with status and metadata |
| `list-variables` | Show environment variables for a service |
| `set-variables` | Set environment variables |
| `get-logs` | Get build or deployment logs |
| `deploy` | Upload and deploy from local directory |
| `generate-domain` | Generate a Railway domain for the service |
| `link-service` | Link to a specific Railway service |
| `link-environment` | Link to a specific Railway environment |
| `create-environment` | Create a new Railway environment |
| `create-project-and-link` | Create and link a new Railway project |
| `deploy-template` | Search and deploy Railway templates |

## Deployment Workflow

### First-Time Setup

1. **Verify CLI authentication:**
   ```
   Use check-railway-status to confirm Railway CLI is logged in
   ```

2. **Link project (if not linked):**
   - User runs `railway login` in terminal
   - User runs `railway link` in the project directory
   - Or use `create-project-and-link` for new projects

3. **Configure root directory** (for monorepos):
   - If app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `web/`, `app/`, `frontend/`), configure in Railway Dashboard:
   - Service → Settings → Source → Root Directory

### Deployment Process

1. **Check current status:**
   ```
   list-deployments with json=true to see recent deployment statuses
   ```

2. **If deployment failed, check logs:**
   ```
   get-logs with logType="build" and the failed deploymentId
   ```

3. **Common build failures:**
   - Missing root directory configuration (monorepos)
   - Syntax errors in code
   - Missing dependencies
   - Invalid environment variables

4. **Deploy changes:**
   - Push to GitHub (auto-deploy if connected)
   - Or use `deploy` tool for manual deployment

### Environment Variables

1. **View current variables:**
   ```
   list-variables with json=true
   ```

2. **Set new variables:**
   ```
   set-variables with variables array like ["KEY=value", "KEY2=value2"]
   ```

3. **Common patterns:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` - Next.js client-safe public variables
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
   - `*_API_KEY` - API keys (server-side only)

### Domain Configuration

1. **Generate Railway domain:**
   ```
   generate-domain to get a *.up.railway.app domain
   ```

2. **Custom domains:**
   - Configure in Railway Dashboard: Service → Settings → Public Networking
   - Add CNAME record at DNS provider pointing to Railway domain

## Framework-Specific Configuration

### Next.js

**railway.toml** (place in app root):
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start"
healthcheckPath = "/"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### NestJS + Prisma

**railway.toml:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "node dist/main.js"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### Node.js/Express

**railway.toml:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "node server.js"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
```

### Python/FastAPI

**railway.toml:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
```

### Python/Django

**railway.toml:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "python manage.py collectstatic --noinput"

[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn myproject.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Railpack could not determine how to build"

**Cause:** Root directory not set for monorepo structures.

**Fix:** Set Root Directory in Railway Dashboard → Service → Settings → Source.

### Build Syntax Errors

**Cause:** Code pushed with syntax errors.

**Fix:** 
1. Check build logs: `get-logs` with `logType="build"`
2. Fix the error locally
3. Push the fix to trigger new deployment

### Missing Environment Variables

**Cause:** Required environment variables not set.

**Fix:**
1. Check current vars: `list-variables`
2. Set missing vars: `set-variables`

### Domain Not Working

**Cause:** DNS not configured or not propagated.

**Fix:**
1. Verify CNAME record points to Railway domain
2. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 72 hours)
3. Check Railway Dashboard for verification status

### Port Configuration

Railway automatically provides a `PORT` environment variable. Ensure your application listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`.

**Node.js:**
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Listening on ${port}`));
```

**Python:**
```python
import os
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
```

## Custom Domain Setup by Provider

### Cloudflare (Recommended)

1. Add CNAME record: `@` → Railway domain
2. Enable Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud)
3. Set SSL/TLS to "Full" (not Full Strict)
4. Enable Universal SSL

### GoDaddy / Providers Without CNAME Flattening

GoDaddy and some providers don't support CNAME flattening for root domains. Options:

1. **Use subdomain:** `www.domain.com` or `app.domain.com` with CNAME record
2. **Migrate DNS to Cloudflare:** Change nameservers in registrar
3. **Use forwarding:** Forward root to www subdomain

### Standard CNAME Setup

For subdomains on any provider:

1. In Railway: Add custom domain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
2. Copy the CNAME target (e.g., `abc123.up.railway.app`)
3. In DNS: Add CNAME record pointing subdomain to Railway target
4. Wait for verification in Railway Dashboard

## Multi-Service Projects (Full Stack)

For projects with frontend + backend + database:

### Architecture

```
Railway Project
├── Frontend Service (Next.js) → goteammate/nextjs-template
├── Backend Service (NestJS) → goteammate/nestjs-template
└── PostgreSQL Database → Railway Postgres template
```

### Setup via MCP Tools

1. `create-project-and-link` — Create the Railway project
2. `deploy-template` with "PostgreSQL" — Add database
3. Connect GitHub repos for frontend and backend services
4. `set-variables` — Wire `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`
5. `generate-domain` — Create domains for each service

### Auto-Wired Variables

| Variable | Service | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Backend | Railway Postgres reference |
| `PORT` | Both | Railway auto-provides |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Backend | Frontend Railway domain |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Frontend | Backend Railway domain |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Frontend | Frontend Railway domain |

### Bootstrap Shortcut

Use the `new-project` skill in `teammate-ops` to automate the entire multi-service setup from a single conversation.
